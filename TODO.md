# TODO for Trips Layout Update

- [x] Replace the table in `wwr/Trips.html` with a responsive grid of trip cards.
  - Create a `.trips-grid` div with individual `.trip-card` divs for each trip.
  - Each card includes image, name, difficulty, duration, price, and description.
- [x] Add CSS styles in `wwr/styles/rafting.css` for `.trips-grid` (responsive grid with auto-fit columns) and `.trip-card` (border, padding, background).
- [x] Test the page in a browser to ensure the grid displays correctly and is responsive.
