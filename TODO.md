# TODO: Add Employee Profiles Section to Contact Page

- [x] Edit `wwr/contact.html` to add a new `<section>` element with class `employee-profiles` below the `.contact-grid` div and above the `<h2>Adventure Awaits You!</h2>`.
  - Include a grid container with three profile cards for Joseph, Mark, and Ben.
  - Each card should have: `<img>` with placeholder src, `<h3>` for name, and `<p>` for description (placeholder).
- [x] Edit `wwr/styles/rafting.css` to add CSS rules for `.employee-profiles` (grid layout with 3 columns, spacing, and basic card styling).
- [x] Verify the layout by opening the page in a browser.
